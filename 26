If Bob leaks his private key in an RSA public-key encryption scheme, he should generate a new private key, but he doesn't necessarily need to generate a new modulus n. RSA security is based on the difficulty of factoring the modulus n. If an attacker has Bob's private key, it means the attacker can decrypt messages intended for Bob, but it doesn't necessarily mean the attacker can factor n and break RSA for other users.

Generating a new modulus n is computationally expensive, and it's generally not required if the modulus is sufficiently large and wasn't compromised. Bob can generate a new set of public and private keys by choosing a new public exponent e' (which is typically a small value like 65537) and a new private exponent d' such that e' and d' are generated correctly and securely. As long as Bob ensures that d' is kept secret and not leaked, the new key pair should be secure.

In summary, if Bob's private key is compromised, he should generate a new private key (d') and a new public key (e') while keeping the existing modulus n as long as it's still secure. Generating a new modulus is not necessary if the current modulus is still considered safe and wasn't compromised.
