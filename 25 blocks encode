In the RSA encryption scheme, having the public key (n, e) and a set of encrypted blocks without the private key (d) generally doesn't help in recovering the plaintext or the private key. The RSA algorithm's security is based on the difficulty of factoring the large composite number n, which is typically the product of two large prime numbers p and q.

If someone tells you that one of the plaintext blocks has a common factor with n, it doesn't significantly impact the security of RSA, assuming that n is large enough and factoring n is still computationally difficult.

In practice, RSA encryption is considered secure as long as the following conditions hold:

n is sufficiently large, making it computationally infeasible to factor n and recover p and q.
The encryption exponent e is chosen properly (usually a small, public exponent).
The plaintext blocks are padded to add randomness and prevent chosen plaintext attacks.
If you suspect that a plaintext block shares a common factor with n, it may indicate some level of encryption weakness or leakage. However, in a secure RSA system, this information alone should not help in breaking the encryption or recovering the private key without performing a full factorization of n.

Therefore, the security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring the large n, and the knowledge that one plaintext block shares a common factor with n doesn't directly compromise the security of RSA encryption if proper key and encryption practices are followed.

In summary, knowledge of a plaintext block sharing a common factor with n doesn't significantly assist in breaking RSA encryption or finding the private key without first successfully factoring the large composite number n, which is computationally challenging.
